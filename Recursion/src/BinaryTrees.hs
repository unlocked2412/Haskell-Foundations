Let's start with a simple "unbalanced" binary search tree representing a set. 
This is a potentially very inefficient data structure, but many efficient data structures and their operations are based on this simple foundation.

data Set a = Tip | Bin !(Set a) !a !(Set a) deriving (Show)

instance Eq a => Eq (Set a) where
    (==) = (==) `on` toList

instance Foldable Set where
    foldMap _ Tip = mempty
    foldMap f (Bin l v r) = foldMap f l <> f v <> foldMap f r

    null Tip = True
    null Bin {} = False

Invariant: in Bin l v r, each element of l is less than v, and each element of r is greater than v.

Exercise 1: I used the word "element" without defining it. In this case, it's the most "obvious" definition. 
Write a recursive definition (in English) of what it means for a value x to be an element of a Set s. 
Try to write the *simplest* definition you can while being precise.

x is not an element of (Tip :: Set a), and
x is an element of (Bin l v r :: Set a) iff
    x is equal to v, or x is an element of l, or x is an element of r

Exercise 2: Write a function

member :: Ord a => a -> Set a -> Bool

with the property that

member x s is True if x is a member of s and false otherwise. Use the ordering invariant to avoid exploring any parts of the tree you don't have to.

Exercise 5: The same data structure can also be used to implement a "bag", sometimes called a "multiset"

data Bag a = Tip | Bin !(Bag a) !a !(Bag a)

The invariant is slightly different though: in Bin l v r, all the elements of l must be less than *or equal to* v, 
while all elements of r must be strictly greater than v. Write versions of:
- member, 
- insert (which inserts an additional copy of an element if it's already there), 
- delete (which only deletes one copy of an element), and 
- deleteMaybe (which also only deletes one copy).
